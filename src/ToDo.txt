Todo:
    - support generation of CHECK CONSTRAINTS in table scripts
    - when comparing entity properties to database schema, match columns on lower-cased names
    - data object Equals method
    - fix indentation in DAO classes
	
    - sqltypes image and binary do not generate correct code for pulling data from a datareader (populating a dataobject).
    - data objects could/should support ICloneable with MemberwiseClone().
    - when loading property attributes, not all overridable values are being loaded (i.e. readerformat)
    - DTD/Schema.  XML validation
    - better validation on load
    - define default types and sqltypes so that they don't have to be defined in every config file if they are default.
    - DataObject, DAO, stored proc, view name formats specifiable in config.xml
	- ident level in generating code

Completed:
    - preservation of custom regions (pull code from regions and insert into generated source before overwritting)
    - when parsing type - add any entities as data objects
    - generate enums
    - update stored procs - if there are no fields other than primary key, don't generate update procs
    - if generated output is the same as the file contents - don't overwrite.  This will help when looking in WinCVS to see what has been modified.
    - check for null before trying to use primitive reader methods in GetDataObjectFromReader method in DAO classes.
    - DAO GetList method should return IList not ICollection
    - load method does not take the correct parameters and types based on identity or primary key columns.
    - configurable base classes for DataObjects, DAOs and Enums.
    - parse enums as types, when parsing types
    - add GetList method with just sort
    - some delete methods still have connection as parameter (when multiple PK columns)
    - support for defined finder methods
    - sort namespaces
    - generation of sql table scripts
