Todo:
	- load method does not take the correct parameters and types based on identity or primary key columns.
	- check for null before trying to use primitive reader methods in GetDataObjectFromReader method in DAO classes.
    - preservation of custom regions (pull code from regions and insert into generated source before overwritting)
    - generation of sql table scripts
	
	- sqltypes image and binary do not generate correct code for pulling data from a datareader (populating a dataobject).
	- data objects could/should support ICloneable with MemberwiseClone().
	- when loading property attributes, not all overridable values are being loaded (i.e. readerformat)
	- DTD/Schema.  XML validation
	- better validation on load
    - parse enums as types, when parsing types
    - define default types and sqltypes so that they don't have to be defined in every config file if they are default.


Completed:
	- when parsing type - add any entities as data objects
	- generate enums
    - update stored procs - if there are no fields other than primary key, don't generate update procs
	- if generated output is the same as the file contents - don't overwrite.  This will help when looking in WinCVS to see what has been modified.
