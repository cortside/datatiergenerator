Todo:
	- sqltypes image and binary do not generate correct code for pulling data from a datareader (populating a dataobject).
	- data objects could/should support ICloneable with MemberwiseClone().
	- when loading property attributes, not all overridable values are being loaded (i.e. readerformat)
	- load method does not take the correct parameters and types based on identity or primary key columns.
	- if generated output is the same as the file contents - don't overwrite.  This will help when looking in WinCVS to see what has been modified.
	- if not using data types, need to check for null before trying to assign to primitive types in GetDataObjectFromReader method in DAO classes.
	- DTD/Schema.  XML validation
	- better validation on load
    - parse enums as types, when parsing types


Completed:
	- when parsing type - add any entities as data objects
	- generate enums
